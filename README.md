> A simple catalogue of US Cities with React/Redux

![us-cities-catalogue screenshot](./src/assets/images/us-cities-screenshot.png)

I developed this project as the capstone project after completing Microverse's React/Redux course. It deals with a simple catalogue of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States) using redux state management. With it: you can get a list of 1000 first United States cities that have a population over 10,0000, city's growth between 2000 and 2013, city's coordinate, and get the link to the city's details which redirects you to Wikipedia. I used SASS to style it.

_Note:_ As the project's requirements found on [this link](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Catalogue-of-Recipes-ea589778a95f47fa98034d99d4016d2b) show the design, the design focuses mainly on mobile view. So as a result this app is better viewed on screens below 768px.
